Some fun facts about me, this site, and an explaination about why there isn't much of it.

So, why not much content? Simple: Not much time. Or rather, too busy doing other things. If I'm not working, studing, or getting sucked into something really interesting on the internet, I'm probably doing martial arts, roller skating, doing yoga in a hot room, riding my bike, walking the dog, cooking and/or eating awesome food, possibly listening to a book while doing any of the above. At the end of a great day the last thing I seem to think about is how much I want to document my day on the internet. Sorry internet :-/

* This site is built using Jekyll - a system that generates static pages from text files written in markdown.
* It's hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), fo' free!
* It's dead simple to create content, and requires basically zero maintenance. No possibility of SQL injection, CSRF, etc. Least time required.

So you see, we're all winners. You don't recieve a 404 or NXDOMAIN when you try my web address, and I can live my life.
