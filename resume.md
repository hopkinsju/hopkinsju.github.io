Currently I manage IT for a library related non-profit. I supervise a small but awesome staff, am responsible for hardware and software budgets, and wear many other hats besides. I&#39;m lucky to have talented people working for me, but I&#39;m no slouch - I frequently get my hands dirty and was personally responsible for building most of the IT infrastructure powering our systems and services.

## Strengths
* management
* Linux sysadmin
* networking
* desktop support
* graphic design and print production
* customer service
* project management
* coding to get the job done

I&#39;m capable in other areas as well, but struggle to find time to focus on them in my current position. I&#39;d really like to spend less time writing emails and more time coding awesome things. Ideally I&#39;d find a position that allowed me to:

* Build on the coding skills I already have
* Work with an awesome team
* Work with modern technologies
* Have fun
