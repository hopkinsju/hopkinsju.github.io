title: Introduction

Currently I manage IT for a library related non-profit. I supervise a small but awesome staff, am responsible for hardware and software budgets, and wear many other hats besides. I&#39;m lucky to have talented people working for me, but I&#39;m no slouch - I frequently get my hands dirty and was personally responsible for building most of the IT infrastructure powering our systems and services.

If you'd like to know more, please have a look at my [resume](/resume), or send me an email at [justin@jhopkins.io](mailto:justin@jhopkins.io).

Thanks
